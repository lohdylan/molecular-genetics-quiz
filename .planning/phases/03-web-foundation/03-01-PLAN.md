<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create question data file for web</name>
  <files>web/questions.js</files>
  <action>
Create a JavaScript file that exports the question data. Read the existing data/questions.json and convert it to a JS module format:

```javascript
const questions = [
  {
    id: "q1-01",
    quiz: "Quiz 1",
    topic: "DNA Structure",
    question: "...",
    options: ["A) ...", "B) ...", ...],
    correct: "B",
    explanation: "..."
  },
  // ... all 49 questions
];
```

Copy ALL questions from data/questions.json - there are 49 total (16 from Quiz 1, 17 from Quiz 2, 16 from Practice Problems).

Use a simple variable declaration (not ES modules) for maximum browser compatibility.
  </action>
  <verify>
File web/questions.js exists and contains "const questions = [" at the start.
Count of questions in file matches 49.
  </verify>
  <done>
web/questions.js contains all 49 questions in browser-compatible JS format.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Build single-page web quiz</name>
  <files>web/index.html</files>
  <action>

**HTML Structure:**
- Container div for quiz content
- Question display area (topic, question number, progress bar, question text)
- Answer buttons container (5 buttons for A-E options)

- Answer buttons: large, clickable, hover states
- Feedback colors: green (#22c55e) for correct, red (#ef4444) for incorrect
- Card-style containers with subtle shadows
- Mobile-first responsive layout

**JavaScript (embedded in script tag):**
- Load questions from questions.js (script loaded before main script)
- Shuffle questions on quiz start using Fisher-Yates
- State: currentQuestion index, score, quizComplete flag
- displayQuestion(): renders current question with options as buttons
- selectAnswer(letter): checks answer, shows feedback, updates score
- nextQuestion(): advances to next or shows final score
- showFinalScore(): displays results with percentage and message
- resetQuiz(): shuffles and restarts

**Quiz Flow:**
1. Page loads -> shuffle questions -> show first question
2. User clicks answer button -> show feedback (correct/incorrect + explanation)
3. User clicks "Next Question" -> advance to next
4. After last question -> show final score screen
5. "Try Again" button -> reset and start over

**Key details:**
- Progress bar: "Question X of 49 [========--] 20%"
- Feedback shows: checkmark/X icon, correct answer if wrong, full explanation
- Final score: "You scored X/49 (XX%)" with encouragement message
- Do NOT auto-advance after answer - require user to click Next
