      "C) The sequence is known beforehand",
      "D) Fragment weight"

    "options": [
      "A) A region of DNA that is always transcribed",

      "C) Any sequence of three nucleotides",
      "D) The promoter region of a gene"
    ],
    "correct": "B",
    "explanation": "An ORF is a stretch of DNA/RNA from a start codon (AUG) to a stop codon with a long sequence of amino acid-coding codons - potentially a gene."

    "question": "Why does finding open reading frames work better in prokaryotes than eukaryotes?",
    "options": [
      "A) Prokaryotes have more genes",

      "C) Prokaryotes have larger genomes",
      "D) Eukaryotes don't use the same genetic code"
    ],
    "correct": "B",
    "explanation": "Introns in eukaryotic genes interrupt the coding sequence, making ORF detection unreliable without knowing where introns are."
